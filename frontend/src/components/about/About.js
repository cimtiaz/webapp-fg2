          <h4>What is Transparent Transaction?</h4>
          Transparent Transaction is a service especially designed for having more safety in
          buying things from other people online. While it is easy and
          definitely cheaper to buy used items online, it is not always a
          success. One can end up buying an item that is not working properly
          without having any insurance to return the item. This is where TrustMe
          enters the picture. You can choose an item, agree on a price with the
          seller and pay for it and have 2 days to test the item and make sure
          it is in the condition the seller claimed it to be while we will keep
          the money for this period of time. Upon your confirmation after two
          days, the transaction will go forward and seller will receive the
          money.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4> Why Transparent Transaction? </h4>
          This transaction is based on trust. We trust in your good nature as an
          honest and responsible individual who will use the 2 days time to
          examine the item and not anything else.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>How does it work?</h4>
          As a user, you can buy and sell items. The seller uploads photos of
          the item along with its description and price. Seller will receive a
          link to the item page which they can share with buyers. Upon
          agreement, the buyer and seller sign an online agreement and the
          transaction will take place only to be withheld for a period of time
          by us. In this time the buyer has the chance to review the item and
          ask to return it if needed.
