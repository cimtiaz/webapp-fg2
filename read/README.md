# Transparent transaction
_Transparent transaction_ is a web application especially designed for people who want to transact with people online. The application will provide guarantee related services for customers of secondhand market. The application owner will act as a third party controller and will have admin access to the signed document, as well as ability to hold payments from the seller until receiving a confirmation from the buyer. 
Buyers do not pay for anything until they receive the item and are happy with it. Sellers do not have to send anything until they know the correct funds are being held securely. 

#What does it do
As a user, you can buy and sell items. The seller uploads photos of the item along with its description and price. Seller will receive a link to the item page which they can share with buyers. Upon agreement, the buyer and seller sign an online agreement and the transaction will take place only to be withheld for a period of time by us. In this time the buyer has the chance to review the item and ask to return it if needed.
